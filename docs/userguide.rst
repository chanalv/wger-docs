A **workout** in wger refers to the set of exercises performed
throughout a single week. When you create a new workout, you
will be selecting which days of the week you will be exercising, and
then choosing what exercises you will be performing on each of those
days.

After you have successfully created a workout, you can log your workout
sessions by adding a new **weight log** to the workout. The weight log
includes information such as the date of the workout session, the
exercises performed, the number of sets per exercises, the number of
repetitions performed for each set, and the weight used for each set.

After creating a workout, you can also save the workout as a **workout
template**. A workout template is a template that you can use as a copy
for creating new workouts.

If you perform the same exercises on the same days every week, then you
can use the same workout every week. For example, your
**workout schedule** may look like the following:

  **Week 1:** Beginner’s Push, Pull, & Leg Routine

  **Week 2:** Beginner’s Push, Pull, & Leg Routine

  **Week 3:** Beginner’s Push, Pull, & Leg Routine

  **Week 4:** Beginner’s Push, Pull, & Leg Routine

However, if your exercises change from week to week, then you will need
to create a new workout for each week that has a different set of
exercises. For example, consider the following workout schedule that
alternates between two different workouts:

  **Week 1:** Chest & Shoulders Routine

  **Week 2:** Legs & Back Routine

  **Week 3:** Chest & Shoulders Routine

  **Week 4:** Legs & Back Routine
